# credential-proxy-sidecar
Credential Proxy Sidecar is a secure, tokenized gateway that enables low-trust orchestrators like n8n, LangChain, or Node-RED to access external APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, AstraDB) without ever storing secrets. It issues short-lived, scoped credentials through a hardened proxy and logs every action for audit compliance.
